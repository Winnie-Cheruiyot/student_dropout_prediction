# 🎓 Student Dropout Prediction App

This is a machine learning web app that predicts whether a student will **Dropout**, **Graduate**, or remain **Enrolled** based on their profile. It uses a trained model and is deployed using **streamli** inside Jupyter Notebook.

## 🚀 Features
- check here (https://student-drop-out-prediction.streamlit.app/)
- Predicts student outcomes using profile features like age, GPA, tuition status, etc.
- Easy-to-use web interface inside Jupyter Notebook (no browser tabs needed).
- Powered by streamlit, Scikit-learn model and pre-processing tools.

## 📦 Requirements

Make sure you have Python and Jupyter installed. Then install these packages:

```bash
pip install streamlit pandas numpy scikit-learn joblib
```

---

## 📁 Files Needed

Ensure these files are in the same folder:
- `student_dropout_model.pkl` – Trained ML model
- `scaler.pkl` – Feature scaler
- `label_encoder.pkl` – Target encoder

---

## 🧪 Run in Jupyter Notebook

1. Open a Jupyter Notebook.
2. Paste the  app.y code into a cell.
3. At the end of the code, make sure it has:

```python
interface.launch(inline=True)
```

4. Run the cell. The app will appear **inline** inside the notebook.
5. Enter student data and view the prediction result.

## 💡 Option: Run as Python Script

If you prefer running it as a normal web app:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Then open the local link (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:7860`) in your browser.
